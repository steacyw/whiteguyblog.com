  I saw a picture today and I wasn't able to tell if it was ai. (I don't capitalize ai because I don't treat computers with respect.)<br>
  Anyway I saw this picture and I wanted to believe that no real human could have such a disgusting body but I suppose anything is possible these days.<br>
  It seems like the internet is over, if everything's just gonna be ai images posted by bots then why bother with it. I think that's kinda cool though, who needs it anyway. Goodbye.<br>
  Take a think (sic) about that, freedom from the internet through entropy and atrophy. If it's all garbage, why engage with it? Though I suppose you could say the same thing about reddit and look at those fuckers over there going hog wild. ha.<br>
  Why do anything? Why even live? I guess I can't begrudge someone their internet slop — but maybe the steady decline in the quality of posting and the uncertainty that an image or video is real will get <i>me personally</i> to stop using all these crap websites.<br>
  I envision a time where I don't look at any of this bullshit and I read the newspaper or something. I go to the bagel cafe and listen to sewerslvt on my bose headphones and get little pieces of onion stuck in my teeth.<br>
  That's basically what my dad does. I think the boomers kinda have it figured out. Angry impotent crying soyjak millennial caricatures will be quick to respond to me saying they can't live without the internet or that I have a civic duty to stay informed or some other hooey. Listen, you can't control yourself and neither can I, that's why we're on there. You cope and seethe and think that you want to be looking at the internet but really you're just the unfortunate victim of a zuckerberg psyop. Like so many others. What are you gonna do about it? Probably nothing. Some day soon I'll be enjoying my onion bagel and looking at little birds and pieces of dust while you compulsively check your cellular and smash those synapses together until they form one long continuous chain of Slop Consumption Protocol.
  In the mean time if you think you'll catch me doing the impotent anger crying soy face over a political reddit post you've got another thing coming pal. No one can harm me. I have value because I was created by God, not because some freak on twitter told me I had the right opinion.<br>

  I been thinkin about is and allot of motherfuckers who come up to me acting gormless end up corporeally formless.<br>
  These jokers see — they queue up to be removed from this earth — theres about to be a dirth, of clowns who are lacking in spiritual girth.,<br><br> 
  On a more serious note, Merry Christmas folks! (That's Happy Holidays for all the wokies out there, hyuck hyuck)
